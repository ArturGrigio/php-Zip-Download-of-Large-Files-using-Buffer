#jQuery Files Select with AJAX call to PHP Zip and Download

This rep is for a piece of software that allows you to view files in a grid, choose the ones you want to download, select them, zip them and download to the client.

##[Zip](https://github.com/ArturGrigio/jQuery-Select-with-PHP-zip-and-Download/blob/master/login/core/zip.php)
Zip requires an array of names to be zipped, and the destination where the images.zip file will be saved. Upon successful zip, a download will be forced. (Note: zip overrides the images.zip file.) 

##[Resize](https://github.com/ArturGrigio/jQuery-Select-with-PHP-zip-and-Download/blob/master/login/core/resize.php)
This is an optional file. In this case I need to process photos and change their size before downloading them.
