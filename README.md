#Zip Files for Download using the buffer

This rep will allows you to create a zip file on the clients device without creating a zip file on the server, and is very light in sense of processing overhead.

##Possible Uses

* If you have several files and the user has to pick the ones he wants before download, this rep will allow you to force a download instantly (without creating a zip file on the server first).
* If you have large files to serve to the client.
